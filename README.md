# Hacker Hues

This is my theme for [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) that can be used with style extensions like [Stylebot](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha),  [Stylus](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne), [Stylish](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe), etc.

I've created so many random adjustments to Hacker News over the years, so I thought it's high time I officialized it. This one tries to maintain the spirit of the original site while adding a some air, reducing the line length, and increasing the font size. It's not comprehensive, as I rarely use some parts of the site, but it covers the main bits.
